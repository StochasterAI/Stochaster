# Stochaster: An Easy-To-Read Neural Network Framework

Stochaster is a versatile neural network framework designed for being readable, clear and concise. The code is divided into the two main categories of objects used in neural networks: Functions and Tensors. Using these two type of objects you can create Mnist models, or transformers. Stochaster might not be as blazing fast as PyTorch or TensorFlow, but you will definately master those faster if you start learning neural networks with Stochaster!
