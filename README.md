# Stochaster: A Versatile Neural Network Framework

Stochaster is a versatile artificial neural network framework designed for being readable, clear and concise. The engine code is divided into the two main categories of objects used in neural networks: Functions and Tensors. The nueral network library (still in development) consists of the implementations of common neural network models using the Stochaster engine.
